# BCT in Minecraft

## Program

A looping string

## Data

3 methods:
* Peek at beginning
* Remove from beginning
* Add to end

## How that should work

0 => delete leftmost data bit
1 => next command, if leftmost data bit is 1, then copy that next command after the rightmost data bit

## How to do leftmost data peeking

1. Unlock the hopper for one tick, the hopper behind it stays locked
2. Run checks on the item
3. Check the flag
4. If 0, make regular action
5. If 1, push to data queue and set the flag to 0
